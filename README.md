# Ténéré
This is the animation engine and development environment for the [Tree of Ténéré](https://www.treeoftenere.com/). It is an open-source application that runs in [Processing](https://processing.org/) using the [P3LX](https://github.com/heronarts/P3LX) framework.

To get started, grab the latest version of Processing 3 at:  https://processing.org/download/

Then, simply clone or download the repo and open the project in Processing. The best way to get started is by having a look at the "Tutorial" tab, which shows how the basic features of pattern construction work.

The LX API reference is available at: [http://lx.studio/api/](http://lx.studio/api/)

Happy coding!
